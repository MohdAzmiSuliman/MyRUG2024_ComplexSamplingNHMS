## National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS)

1.  **Nationwide Health Survey**: Conducted by Ministry of Health Malaysia to assess health status and healthcare needs of Malaysian population.

2.  **Conducted Regularly**: Since 1986, initially 10 years gap, then 5 years, then yearly with different themes.

3.  **Focus on Key Health Indicators**: e.g. NCDs, CDs, healthcare demands

4.  **Representative Population Sampling**: Represent National, with various age groups and ethnicities.

5.  **National Health Policy**: Findings use for national health policies and initiatives.

::: notes
1.  **Nationwide Health Survey**: The National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) is a nationwide survey conducted by the Ministry of Health Malaysia to assess the health status and healthcare needs of the Malaysian population.

2.  **Conducted Regularly**: NHMS has been conducted periodically since 1986, providing essential data for public health planning, policy-making, and monitoring health trends over time.

3.  **Focus on Key Health Indicators**: NHMS covers a wide range of topics, including non-communicable diseases (NCDs), infectious diseases, lifestyle factors, mental health, and healthcare utilization.

4.  **Representative Population Sampling**: NHMS uses advanced sampling techniques to ensure accurate representation of the Malaysian population across different states, age groups, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds.

5.  **National Health Policy**: The findings from NHMS are crucial for developing national health policies and initiatives aimed at improving the overall health and well-being of Malaysians.

# Census vs Survey

## Census vs Survey

-   **Census**: Collects data from every individual in the population.
    -   Time-consuming, expensive, and not feasible for large populations.
    -   e.g. DOSM conducts Population and Housing Census every 10 years.

. . .

-   **Survey**: Collects data from a sample of the population.
    -   More cost-effective, less time-consuming
    -   But does it to represent the entire population?

## Why Not Simple Random Sampling (SRS)?

-   **Simple Random Sampling (SRS)**: Each individual theoretically has an equal chance of being selected.
    -   While easy to implement, it's often impractical for large, diverse populations.
    -   SRS assumes homogeneity, which rarely exists in real-world populations, leading to potential biases in representation.

. . .

-   **Challenges of SRS**:
    -   Requires a **complete and up-to-date list** of the entire population to ensure equal selection chances.
    -   In practice, even DOSM do not have complete population lists, making true random sampling difficult, if not impossible.

# Simple Randon Survey (SRS)

## The Risk of Underrepresentation

-   In SRS, mathematically, the sample may not adequately represent the population, especially for minority groups.
-   On the next slide, we will simulate how SRS can affect representation in a hypothetical population.

## Hypothetical Population Composition

-   Imagine a population of 1,000 individuals:
    -   46% are Malay
    -   33% are Chinese
    -   25% are Indian
    -   1% are Borneo

```{r}
#| echo: true

sim_pop <- tibble(ethnicity = c(rep("Malay", 460), 
                                rep("Chinese", 330), 
                                rep("Indian", 250), 
                                rep("Borneo", 10)))

sim_pop %>% 
  count(ethnicity) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

## SRS Simulation

-   If we take a simple random sample (SRS) of 50 people from this population, will anyone from the **Borneo** group be selected?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

sim_pop %>% 
  sample_n(50) %>% 
  count(ethnicity)
```

. . .

```{r}
sim_pop %>% 
  sample_n(50) %>% 
  count(ethnicity)
```

. . .

-   Let's try it again:

```{r}
sim_pop %>% 
  sample_n(50) %>% 
  count(ethnicity)
```

## Key Takeaways from the Simulation

-   And One More Time

```{r}
sim_pop %>% 
  sample_n(50) %>% 
  count(ethnicity)
```

. . .

-   As shown in this short simulation, **Simple Random Sampling** may or may not select individuals from the **Borneo** group, which makes up only 1% of the population.
-   To ensure that the **Borneo** group is properly represented in the sample, we may need to use **stratified sampling** to guarantee their inclusion.

# Complex Sampling Design

## NHMS & Complex Sampling Design

-   To ensure national representativeness, NHMS uses complex sampling design.
    -   Stratification - 2 Stage Stratification, State & Urban/Rural
    -   Clustering (DOSM's enumeration block)

. . .

-   Sampling was done at 2 stages:
    -   Primary Sampling Unit: Selection of Enumeration Blocks (EBs)
    -   Secondary Sampling Units: Selection of Living Quarters (LQs) within EBs

. . .

-   EBs: Geographical areas in Malaysia divide by DOSM
-   LQs: Households within EBs, approximately 80-120 LQs per EB


## Complex Sampling Design

-   These stratification and clustering however affect the sampling probability, and thus the estimation need to consider for this complex sampling design. 
-   Therefore, each unit is assigned a weight to account for the probability of selection.


## Sampling Weight in NHMS

-   The sampling weight is calculated as follows:
    -   W1 = the inverse probability of selecting the EBs
    -   F = the non-response adjustment factor
    -   PS = post-stratification adjustment factor calculated by state, gender and ethnicity
