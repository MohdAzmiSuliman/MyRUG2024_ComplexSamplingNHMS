## National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS)

1.  **Nationwide Health Survey**: Conducted by Ministry of Health Malaysia to assess health status and healthcare needs of Malaysian population.

2.  **Conducted Regularly**: Since 1986, initially 10 years gap, then 5 years, then yearly with different themes.

3.  **Focus on Key Health Indicators**: e.g. NCDs, CDs, healthcare demands

4.  **Representative Population Sampling**: Represent National, with various age groups and ethnicities.

5.  **National Health Policy**: Findings use for national health policies and initiatives.

::: notes
1.  **Nationwide Health Survey**: The National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) is a nationwide survey conducted by the Ministry of Health Malaysia to assess the health status and healthcare needs of the Malaysian population.

2.  **Conducted Regularly**: NHMS has been conducted periodically since 1986, providing essential data for public health planning, policy-making, and monitoring health trends over time.

3.  **Focus on Key Health Indicators**: NHMS covers a wide range of topics, including non-communicable diseases (NCDs), infectious diseases, lifestyle factors, mental health, and healthcare utilization.

4.  **Representative Population Sampling**: NHMS uses advanced sampling techniques to ensure accurate representation of the Malaysian population across different states, age groups, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds.

5.  **National Health Policy**: The findings from NHMS are crucial for developing national health policies and initiatives aimed at improving the overall health and well-being of Malaysians.

# Census vs Survey

## Census vs Survey

-   **Census**: Collects data from every individual in the population.
    -   Time-consuming, expensive, and not feasible for large populations.
    -   e.g. DOSM conducts Population and Housing Census every 10 years.

. . .

-   **Survey**: Collects data from a sample of the population.
    -   More cost-effective, less time-consuming
    -   But does it to represent the entire population?

## Why Not Simple Random Sampling (SRS)?

-   **Simple Random Sampling (SRS)**: Each individual theoretically has an equal chance of being selected.
    -   While easy to implement, it's often impractical for large, diverse populations.
    -   SRS assumes homogeneity, which rarely exists in real-world populations, leading to potential biases in representation.

. . .

-   **Challenges of SRS**:
    -   Requires a **complete and up-to-date list** of the entire population to ensure equal selection chances.
    -   In practice, even DOSM do not have complete population lists, making true random sampling difficult, if not impossible.

# Simple Randon Survey (SRS)

## The Risk of Underrepresentation

-   In SRS, mathematically, the sample may not adequately represent the population, especially for minority groups.
-   On the next slide, we will simulate how SRS can affect representation in a hypothetical population.

## Hypothetical Population Composition

-   Imagine a population of 1,000 individuals:
    -   46% are Malay
    -   33% are Chinese
    -   25% are Indian
    -   1% are Borneo

```{r}
#| echo: true

sim_pop <- tibble(ethnicity = c(rep("Malay", 460), 
                                rep("Chinese", 330), 
                                rep("Indian", 250), 
                                rep("Borneo", 10)))

sim_pop %>% 
  count(ethnicity) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

## SRS Simulation

-   If we take a simple random sample (SRS) of 50 people from this population, will anyone from the **Borneo** group be selected?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

sim_pop %>% 
  sample_n(50) %>% 
  count(ethnicity)
```

. . .

```{r}
sim_pop %>% 
  sample_n(50) %>% 
  count(ethnicity)
```

. . .

-   Let's try it again:

```{r}
sim_pop %>% 
  sample_n(50) %>% 
  count(ethnicity)
```

## Key Takeaways from the Simulation

-   And One More Time

```{r}
sim_pop %>% 
  sample_n(50) %>% 
  count(ethnicity)
```

. . .

-   As shown in this short simulation, **Simple Random Sampling** may or may not select individuals from the **Borneo** group, which makes up only 1% of the population.
-   To ensure that the **Borneo** group is properly represented in the sample, we may need to use **stratified sampling** to guarantee their inclusion.

# Complex Sampling Design

## NHMS & Complex Sampling Design

-   To ensure national representativeness, NHMS uses complex sampling design.
    -   Stratification - 2 Stage Stratification, State & Urban/Rural
    -   Clustering (DOSM's enumeration block)

. . .

-   Sampling was done at 2 stages:
    -   Primary Sampling Unit: Selection of Enumeration Blocks (EBs)
    -   Secondary Sampling Units: Selection of Living Quarters (LQs) within EBs

. . .

-   EBs: Geographical areas in Malaysia divide by DOSM
-   LQs: Households within EBs, approximately 80-120 LQs per EB

## Complex Sampling Design

-   These stratification and clustering however affect the sampling probability, and thus the estimation need to consider for this complex sampling design.
-   Therefore, each unit is assigned a weight to account for the probability of selection.

## Sampling Weight in NHMS

-   The sampling weight is calculated as follows:
    -   W1 = the inverse probability of selecting the EBs
    -   W2 = the inverse probability of selecting the LQs
    -   F = the non-response adjustment factor
    -   PS = post-stratification adjustment factor calculated by state, gender and ethnicity

# NHMS 2023

## NHMS 2023: Non-communicable Diseases & Healthcare Demand

-   In 2023, Institute for Public Health (Institut Kesihatan Umum, IKU), has conducted National Health and Morbidity Survey, with theme for NCD & Health Care Demand.
-   Reports can be access from IKU's website.

![](Images/NHMS2024_IKUPage.png)

## NHMS 2023: Sampling Method

-   Data collection took place between **11 July and 29 September 2023**.
-   A total of **5,006 households (living quarters)** were successfully visited.
-   **13,616 respondents** participated in the survey.
-   These respondents were used to estimate the **Malaysian adult population**, approximately **22 million**.

## NHMS 2023: Findings

-   Various modules were included in NHMS 2023, on NCDs and healthcare demand.
-   The cholesterol module, for example, used based on WHO's STEPwise approach.
-   Out of all of respondents, 4,353 were classified as having raised total cholesterol.
-   These 4,353 respondent with raised total cholesterol reflected to prevalence of 33.3%, or estimated 7.6 million Malaysian adults.


# Analysing Complex Sampling Design

## Simulating Complex Sampling Design.

-   NHMS data was confidential, and I was not allow to share the data.
-   Public (or researcher) can applied the data via NIH Data Repository thru https://nihdars.nih.gov.my/
-   However, for this session purpose, I will simulate simple data to demonstrate complex sampling design.
-   Population data will be used from 2023 Malaysia population data from opendosm
https://open.dosm.gov.my/data-catalogue/population_district
-   While disease data will be simulate. 
-   Please note that since the data is simulate, IT MUST NOT USE FOR REAL WORLD PUPROSE / REFERENCE

## Simulating Population

-   Imagine we want to collect data, similar to NHMS, on cholesterol level among Malaysian adults.
-   the target population is between the 3 major ethnicities - Malay, Chinese and Indian, both male and female, age between 20 to 59 years old.
-   Based on opendosm dataset, there were 160 district (Administrative District) across 16 states in Malaysia (13 states + 3 federal territories)
-   In 2023, the population that cover the target population was 12.8 million

```{r}
pop_mydist <- read_parquet("https://storage.dosm.gov.my/population/population_district.parquet") %>% 
  filter(date == dmy("01/01/23"), 
         sex != "overall", 
         age %in% c("20-24", "24-29", "30-34", "35-39", "40-44", 
                    "45-49", "50-54", "55-59"), 
         ethnicity %in% c("bumi_malay", "chinese", "indian"))

head(pop_mydist)
```


```{r}
pop_mydist %>% 
  summarise(population = sum(population*1000)) %>% 
  mutate(population = scales::label_comma()(population))

```



## Simulating Population



-   The 16 states were group into 5 major zones - namely *Utara*, *Selatan*, *Timur*, *Tengah* and *Borneo*.
-   We will select 2 district (randomly) from each zone for our study.
-   The selected district is as below


```{r}
#| eval: false

set.seed(121)
selected_district <- pop_mydist %>% 
  distinct(state, district) %>% 
  mutate(zone = case_when(state %in% c("Johor", "Melaka", 
                                      "Negeri Sembilan") ~ "Selatan", 
                         state %in% c("Kedah", "Perak", 
                                      "Perlis", "Pulau Pinang") ~ "Utara", 
                         state %in% c("Kelantan", "Pahang", 
                                      "Terengganu") ~ "Timur", 
                         state %in% c("Selangor", "W.P. Kuala Lumpur", 
                                      "W.P. Putrajaya") ~ "Tengah", 
                         state %in% c("Sabah", "Sarawak", 
                                      "W.P. Labuan") ~ "Borneo")) %>% 
  group_by(zone) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 2) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  relocate(zone, .before = 1)

selected_district 

```

```{r}
selected_district <- read_rds("0_PrepDataSim/selected_district.rds")
selected_district 
```

## Simulating Participant

-   From each 10 district, we will sample 40 participants.
-   Simulation using simstudy package (not in this scope)

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(simstudy)

def <- defData(varname = "gender", dist = "binary", formula = 0.5, 
               link = "identity") %>% 
  defData(varname = "age", dist = "uniform", formula = "20;59") %>% 
  defData(varname = "ethnicity", dist = "categorical", 
          formula = "0.57;0.29;0.14") %>% 
  defData(varname = "BMI", dist = "normal", formula = 26, variance = 2.6^2) %>% 
  defData(varname = "height", dist = "normal", formula = 165, variance = 5) %>% 
  defData(varname = "PAhour", dist = "uniform", formula = "2;6") %>% 
  defData(varname = "hba1c", dist = "normal", variance = 1.4^2, 
          formula = "2.4 + 0.05 * age + 0.1 * BMI - 0.15 * PAhour")

set.seed(121)
simnhmsds0 <- genData(400, def) %>% 
  mutate(gender = case_when(gender == 0 ~ "Male", 
                            gender == 1 ~ "Female"), 
         agegp = cut(age, 
                     breaks = c(19, 29, 39, 49, 59), 
                     labels = c("20-29", "30-39", "40-49", "50-59")), 
         ethnicity = case_when(ethnicity == 1 ~ "Malay", 
                               ethnicity == 2 ~ "Chinese", 
                               ethnicity == 3 ~ "Indian"), 
         weight = BMI * (height/100)^2, 
         across(.cols = c(hba1c, weight), 
                .fns = ~ round(., 1)), 
         across(.cols = c(height), 
                .fns = ~ round(., 2)), 
         district = rep(1:10, each = 40), 
         across(.cols = c(district, age, height, PAhour), 
                .fns = ~ as.integer(.))) %>% 
  relocate(weight, .after = height) %>% 
  select(id, district, everything(), -BMI) %>% 
  right_join(selected_district %>% mutate(n = 1:10), ., 
            by = c("n" = "district")) %>% 
  select(id, zone:district, gender:age, agegp, everything(), -n)
```

```{r}
head(simnhmsds0)
```


## Remove "Non-response"

-   In our simulation, assume response rate differ by zone, but same for the zone
    -   "Utara" = 36/40
    -   "Selatan" = 34/40 
    -   "Timur" = 38/40
    -   "Tengah" = 32/40
    -   "Borneo" = 38/40

```{r}
sample_sizes <- list("Utara" = 36, "Selatan" = 34, 
                     "Timur" = 38, "Tengah" = 32, "Borneo" = 38)

simnhmsds_split <- simnhmsds0 %>%
  group_split(zone, .keep = TRUE)

set.seed(121)
simnhmsds_final <- map(simnhmsds_split, function(data) {
  zone <- unique(data$zone)
  data %>%
    group_by(district) %>%
    slice_sample(n = sample_sizes[[zone]]) %>%
    ungroup()
}) %>%
  bind_rows() %>% 
  arrange(id)

simnhmsds_final %>% 
  count(district)
```



# Calculate Sampling Weight


## Preparing Sampling Weight

-   Sampling weight as W1, F and PS. In our simulation, 
    -   W1 is the inverse probability of selecting the district
    -   F is the non-response adjustment factor
    -   PS is the post-stratification adjustment factor calculated

## District Selection

-   The selected district is as below
-   The probability of selecting district, is number of selected district divide by total district, in this case, per zone.
-   The weight is inverse probability
-   Thus the weight for district selection, for example for borneo zone, is 68 (total district in borneo), divide by 2 (selected district in borneo)

```{r}
pop_mydist %>% 
  distinct(state, district) %>% 
  mutate(zone = case_when(state %in% c("Johor", "Melaka", 
                                      "Negeri Sembilan") ~ "Selatan", 
                         state %in% c("Kedah", "Perak", 
                                      "Perlis", "Pulau Pinang") ~ "Utara", 
                         state %in% c("Kelantan", "Pahang", 
                                      "Terengganu") ~ "Timur", 
                         state %in% c("Selangor", "W.P. Kuala Lumpur", 
                                      "W.P. Putrajaya") ~ "Tengah", 
                         state %in% c("Sabah", "Sarawak", 
                                      "W.P. Labuan") ~ "Borneo")) %>% 
  count(zone) %>% 
  rename(total_district = n) %>% 
  mutate(selected_district = 2, 
         f1 = selected_district / total_district, 
         W1 = 1/f1)
```

## Non-response Weight

-   The non-response adjustment factor (F) is calculated as the inverse of the response rate.
-   In each district, we will sample 40 respondents
-   In our simulation, assume response rate differ by zone, but same for the zone
    -   "Utara" = 36/40
    -   "Selatan" = 34/40 
    -   "Timur" = 38/40
    -   "Tengah" = 32/40
    -   "Borneo" = 38/40
-   Thus the weight for example for borneo is 40 (total sample) divide by 38 (success respondent)

```{r}
selected_district %>% 
  mutate(fnr = case_when(zone == "Utara" ~ 36/40, 
                       zone == "Selatan" ~ 34/40, 
                       zone == "Timur" ~ 38/40, 
                       zone == "Tengah" ~ 32/40, 
                       zone == "Borneo" ~ 38/40), 
         F = 1/fnr)
```


## Post-stratification Weight

-   Post-stratification adjustment factor (PS) is a bit tricky. 
-   The idea is we want each sample will represent the population, by it stratification type.
-   For example, in this simulation, we will post-strat to age group, gender and ethnicity.
-   For that, we need to calculate, for each age group, gender and ethnicity, how many sample in our sample, and how many population is in the population.

```{r}
pop_mydist %>% 
  mutate(agegp = case_when(age %in% c("20-24", "24-29") ~ "20-29", 
                          age %in% c("30-34", "35-39") ~ "30-39", 
                          age %in% c("40-44", "45-49") ~ "40-49", 
                          age %in% c("50-54", "55-59") ~ "50-59")) %>% 
  group_by(sex, agegp, ethnicity) %>% 
  summarise(population = sum(population))
```


## Selecting District
